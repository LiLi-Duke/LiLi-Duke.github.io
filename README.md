### Who am I?

I'm a data scientist/machine learning engineer/data nerd, whatever you want to name it. But basically, I enjoy making sense of data and making predictive models. 

I come from Economics/Statistics background into data science domain. My major in both college and graduate school is Economics & Mathematics. So my modeling experience started from Econometrics/Statistics. 

But right now, I'm a hybrid of model developer + some kinda of engineer + problem solver. I built my hybrid "attribute" from my working experience during the last several years at Capital One, where I was model developer for credit card underwriting models (that determine approve/decline + credit line assignment decisions for $13B annual exposure) and credit card fraud models. I gained the end-to-end experience from gathering data to building model and eventually to deploy model into production environment. Right now, I'm a full time data scientist at Visa, where I'm focused on credit card transaction fraud models for the largest payment processing network in the world.
